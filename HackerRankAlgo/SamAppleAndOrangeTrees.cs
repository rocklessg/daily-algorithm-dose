// Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit.
// Using the information given below, determine the number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house.

//In the diagram below:

//The red region denotes the house, where  is the start point, and  is the endpoint.
//The apple tree is to the left of the house, and the orange tree is to its right.
//Assume the trees are located on a single point, where the apple tree is at
//point, and the orange tree is at point .
//When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands  units of distance from its
//tree of origin along the -axis. * A negative value of means the fruit fell
//units to the tree's left, and a positive value of  means it falls  units to the tree's right. *
//Apple and orange(2).png

//Given the value of  for  apples and  oranges, determine how many apples and oranges
//will fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive range )?

//For example, Sam's house is between  and . The apple tree is located at  and the
//orange at . There are  apples and  oranges. Apples are thrown  units distance
//from , and  units distance. Adding each apple distance to the position of the
//tree, they land at . Oranges land at . One apple and two oranges land in the inclusive range  so we print

//Function Description

//Complete the countApplesAndOranges function in the editor below.It should print the
//number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house, each on a separate line.

//countApplesAndOranges has the following parameter(s) :

//s: integer, starting point of Sam's house location.
//t: integer, ending location of Sam's house location.
//a: integer, location of the Apple tree.
//b: integer, location of the Orange tree.
//apples: integer array, distances at which each apple falls from the tree.
//oranges: integer array, distances at which each orange falls from the tree.
//Input Format

//The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of and .
//The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of and .
//The third line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of and .
//The fourth line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each apple falls from point .
//The fifth line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each orange falls from point .

//Constraints

//Output Format

//Print two integers on two different lines:

//The first integer: the number of apples that fall on Sam's house.
//The second integer: the number of oranges that fall on Sam's house.
//Sample Input 0

//7 11
//5 15
//3 2
//-2 2 1
//5 -6
//Sample Output 0
